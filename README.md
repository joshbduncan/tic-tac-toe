# Python Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first attempt at a game while learning Python...

## tic-tac-toe.py
Currently a HUMAN (X) vs. CPU (O) game. Minimax provides suggested AI play for O for testing.

## Updates

**2020-03-27 - Game Play Options**
Now the game prints out the CPU (O) players previous move to make it easier to track.
